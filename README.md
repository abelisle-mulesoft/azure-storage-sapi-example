# Azure Storage System API Example
This repository contains resources to assist in implementing Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 integrations using the [Azure Storage REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices) and the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform.
- The folder **anypoint-studio-project** includes the implementation of a simple API that exposes a single resource, `/block-blobs`, and a single `Post` method. It creates (or updates) a block blob in Azure Storage and sets its content to the object you include in the request body.
- The folder **documentation** contains a [how to guide](documentation/how-to-guide.md) for integrating with Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. First, it guides you through an approach to configuring your Azure account and provisioning all the required resources. Then, it describes the sample system API to illustrate how to integrate with Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- The folder **postman-collection** contains four preconfigured requests you could use for testing your Azure configuration. Using Postman allows to fine-tune calling vendors' APIs more quickly. You can make changes and call APIs in seconds using Postman, whereas you need to rebuild the Mule application before you can test any changes, even if they are minor.
