# Azure Storage System API Example
In the current revision, this repository contains a sample system API to illustrate how to integrate with Azure Storage.
- The folder **anypoint-studio-project** includes the implementation of a simple API that exposes a single resource, `/block-blobs`, and a single `Post` method. It creates (or updates) a block blob in Azure Storage and sets its content to the object you include in the request body.
- The folder **documentation** contains a [how to guide](documentation/how-to-guide.md) for integrating with Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. First, it guides you through our approach to configuring our Azure account and provisioning all the required resources. Then, it describes the sample system API to illustrate how to integrate with with Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- The folder **postman-collection** contains four preconfigured requests we use for testing our Azure configuration. Using Postman allows us to fine-tune calling vendors' APIs more quickly. You can make changes and call APIs in seconds using Postman, whereas you need to rebuild the Mule application before you can test any changes, even if they are minor.
